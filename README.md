# GoFrench
GoFrench is a French to English (and vice versa) translation tool. It finds the best translation and definition for a word or phrase from two sources. (WordReference and Linguee) 

### How does it work?
To use GoFrench, simply enter a word or phrase into the text box. If you only enter one word, you will be sent to WordReference which does a really good job at describing a specific word. If you type in multiple words, however, you will be sent to Linguee, a website that gives great definitions and translations for multiple words and phrases.

### Why should I use GoFrench?
If you can just go the WordReference or Linguee, why would you use GoFrench? Put simply, it simplifies the process. Being able to get the best result from one source saves a lot of time, especially during class. It's easy to use like Google Translate, but also provides more accurate translations and a definition.
